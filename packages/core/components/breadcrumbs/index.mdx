### Breadcrumbs
The `Breadcrumbs` component is used to display a clickable path through the app
hierarchy to the current screen.

Currently the `path` gets passed in as an array of `{name, url}` objects representing
the nodes of the path. Use the `highlightCurrent` prop to highlight the last node.

Future versions should:
- Integrate with React Router.
- Accommodate images as optional node names (eg, app logo).


<Playground>
  <Breadcrumbs 
    highlightCurrent
    path={[{
      name: "Home",
      url: "/"
    },
    {
      name: "Places",
      url: "/places/"
    }]}></Breadcrumbs>
</Playground>
