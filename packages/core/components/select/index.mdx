# Select

A native select element. `appearance` is set to `none` and a custom arrow icon is
rendered.

Can be controlled or uncontrolled. For controlled, you must supply the
`value` and `onChange` props.

For uncontrolled, you must omit the `value` prop. And optionally supply the
`defaultValue` prop.
