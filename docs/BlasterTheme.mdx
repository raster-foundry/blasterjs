# Blaster Theme

BlasterJS Components come with built-in access to the default Blaster theme, by wrapping your application with the `Blaster` component. The theme file contains predefined values for common variables such as color, fonts, spacing and more. The Blaster theme structure is based on Styled-System's [theme specification](https://styled-system.com/theme-specification/#key-reference).

The Style Props on our components give direct access to the theme keys. For example, if you'd like to set the `border-radius` on a `<Box>` you can specify a value in the theme: `<Box borderRadius="small">`.

With the help of Styled-System, this will automatically do a lookup to find the value of the key `radii.small` in the theme and applies the corresponding CSS.

Our base theme is as follows:

<pre>
  {JSON.stringify(baseTheme, fileMetaFilter, '\t')}
</pre>

To understand how to customize the theme, see the [documentation]((/primitives/blaster)) on the `Blaster` component.
